Welcome to Absolum's GitHub page, here we will share our all of our code via the MIT-License for all of you to use in your own projects.

### Programming

### Bespoke-IT
Bespoke-IT is our way of handeling business, all solutions we deliver will always be focussed on your wants and needs and not what may be the "best" solution but what is the easiest to use for you and your team. 

We feel that in most cases the "best"
solultion might not be the best one for you and we try to make everything perfect for your needs not any one elses.

## What code will Absolum share?
We will try to share all the code and projects that we are working on, with or will in the future. The only code we won't share is code for our clients unless they specifically allow it to be shared.

## Why the MIT-License
It seems to fit most of our projects the best so we decided this would be the License we would use for everything.
